## Vulnerable Application

A heap based buffer overflow exists in the sudo command line utility that can be exploited by a local attacker
to gain elevated privileges. The vulnerability was introduced in July of 2011 and affects version 1.8.2
through 1.8.31p2 as well as 1.9.0 through 1.9.5p1 in their default configurations. The technique used by this
implementation leverages the overflow to overwrite a `service_user` struct in memory to reference an attacker
controlled library which results in it being loaded with the elevated privileges held by sudo.

### Manual Target

The exploit requires a number of lengths / offsets to function correctly. The manual target can be used to specify
these values if they are known. To identify the values, use the `brute.sh` script from the original PoC repository at
[blasty/CVE-2021-3156][1].

On the target system, the rough steps include:

1. Clone the repository, install necessary build tools and GNU parallel (`sudo apt-get install parallel` on Debian-based
  systems)
1. Do: `make brute`
1. Do: `./brute.sh ...` with the desired options to bruteforce, (see the [README.md][2])
1. Wait for the bruteforce to complete, hopefully finding a successful option.

    Successful results will be written to the `success.txt` file. They will look something like this:
    
    ```
    ** CVE-2021-3156 PoC by blasty <peter@haxx.in>
    
    using target: Manual ['/usr/bin/sudoedit'] (56, 57, 60, 200)
    ** pray for your rootshell.. **
    [+] bl1ng bl1ng! We got it!
    ```
    
    In this case `56, 57, 60, 200` are the required values.

1. From Metasploit
    1. Do: `set TARGET Manual` to specify the manual target
    1. Do: `set Lengths 56, 57, 60, 200` to set the explicit lengths (substitute the numbers as necessary)

## Verification Steps
Example steps in this format (is also in the PR):

1. Install the application
1. Start msfconsole
1. Do: `use exploit/linux/local/sudo_baron_samedit`
1. Set the necessary options (target, payload, etc.)
1. Do: `run`

## Options

### WritableDir

A directory where you can write files. The necessary source code will be uploaded and compiled to here, along with the
payload library.

### Lengths
*This is an advanced option.*

The lengths to set as used by the manual target. See the "Manual Target" section.
