###
#
# This class is a special case of the generic module set class because
# payloads are generated in terms of combinations between various
# components, such as a stager and a stage.  As such, the payload set
# needs to be built on the fly and cannot be simply matched one-to-one
# with a payload module.  Yeah, the term module is kind of overloaded
# here, but eat it!
